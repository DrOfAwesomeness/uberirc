UberIRC uses a "master is always stable" workflow. This means that all development (after v0.1.0 has been tagged) happens in a `develop` branch on Github. This means that all pull requests should be made to the `develop` branch, which will be merged into `master` for each version released.

## Contributing workflow
1. Fork the repository
2. Make changes to the `develop` branch
3. Open a Pull Request to merge your changes from your `develop` branch into the UberIRC `develop` branch
4. After your code has been reviewed and you have answered any concerns set forth by others, your Pull Request will be merged or denied.
5.  Profit!
